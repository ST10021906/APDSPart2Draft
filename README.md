# Steps to run

+ cd secure-login-portal
+ npm install cors
+ open server.js and press f5 select node.js

+ cd secure-login-frontend
+ npm install
+ npm start
+ open Login.js
+ for some reason cors works wierd and one will have to open that file to get the frontend to work if still does not work close and open the links it gives u when u run npm start in the frontend folder 

## EXAMPLE:
You can now view secure-login-frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.:3000
